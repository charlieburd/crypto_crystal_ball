# Group Project

## Project Idea

Create an interactive map that displays environment indicators for specific areas, such as the air quality for different counties. The tool's intended purpose will be for home buyers/builders to be able to gage which areas of a landscape are deemed the most environmentally friendly or are projected to be in the future. The data will be sources from the cenus or all ready cleaned github packages.

Our machine learning model will be based around a linear regression. It will look at our indicators over a period of 10 years and help forecast which areas will continue to improve their environmental initiatives.

TBD are which indicators we would like to measure (air quality, noise pollution, park space), the area covered by the tool (the entire country, state, city) and the size of the scored sectors (county, zip code, neighborhood).
