## Machine Learning Model
> Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction with Machine Learning for the Next 30 Days

In our final project, our team used Machine Learning Support Vector Regression (SVR) model as a Data Science and Analytics cryptocurrency prediction.

## Resources and DataSets:
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study:

* Data Source: `Bitcoin_1_Min_Historical_Data_2012_to_2020.csv` from [Bitcoin Historical Data](https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data)
* Data Tools:  `MyBitcoinPredictionApp.ipynb`.
* Software: `Python 3.9`, `Visual Studio Code 1.50.0`, `Anaconda 4.8.5`, `Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4` and `Pandas` 

## Database Integration
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. Youâ€™ll submit the following:

1. ***Deliverable 1:*** Linear Regression to Predict MPG
2. ***Deliverable 2:*** Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
3. ***Deliverable 3:*** T-Test on Suspension Coils
4. ***Deliverable 4:*** Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition


## Project Idea

Create a model that will predict crypto prices. The model will be trained/tested with Bitcoin 2020 pricing data and applied to other cryptocurrencies that may mimic the behavior of bitcoin. Bitcoin family cryptos would have the closest similarities, like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.
