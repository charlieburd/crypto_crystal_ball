# Group Project

## Project Idea

Create a model that will predict crypto prices. The model will be trained/tested with Bitcoin 2020 pricing data and applied to other cryptocurrencies that may mimic the behavior of bitcoin. Bitcoin family cryptos would have the closest similarities, like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.
