# Group Project

## Project Idea

Create an interactive map that displays environment indicators for specific areas, such as the air quality for different counties. The tool's intended purpose will be for home buyers/builders to be able to gage which areas of a landscape are deemed the most environmentally friendly or are projected to be in the future.

TBD are which indicators we would like to measure, the area covered by the tool (country, state, city) and the size of the scored sectors (county, zip code, neighborhood)
